# Unit 1 Summary – Ian Hedges

**October 2025**

My goal in this project was to use The Look dataset to uncover growth opportunities and risks, with a focus on the “Active” product category and customer behavior. I applied SQL CTEs and window functions to calculate three key KPIs: monthly revenue growth, repeat purchase rate, and average order value (AOV).  

At first, I assumed the “Active” category was performing consistently across the business. However, after validation, I realized that my early interpretation was incomplete. By breaking down results by device, region, and marketing channel, I found that mobile customers generated the highest order volume but had lower AOV compared to desktop users. I also confirmed that no discounts were being applied, which reframed my recommendation: instead of reducing discounts, the company should introduce them strategically to attract new customers and reward loyal ones.  

For visualization, I built an interactive Plotly chart in Colab to track monthly revenue and growth rates. The ability to hover and filter dynamically revealed seasonal spikes and device‑driven differences that static charts would have hidden. This interactivity made the business story clearer and more compelling for decision‑makers.  

By the end of the DIVE process, I proposed two main recommendations:  
1. **Introduce targeted discounts** in the “Active” category to drive new conversions and reward repeat customers.  
2. **Optimize the mobile experience** in high‑volume regions to increase AOV and improve conversion efficiency.  
 

Taken together, my recommendations provide The Look with a roadmap to convert rapid growth into long‑term, sustainable success.
