## üß© Debugging Prompts ‚Äî Investigate Phase (Fail ‚Üí Fix)

### ‚ùå Prompt 1 ‚Äì Initial Attempt
**Prompt to Gemini**
> Write a BigQuery SQL query joining order_items, products, and users to analyze category-level revenue by gender and average discount amount.  
> Include the column i.discount_amount and aggregate results by category and gender.

**Error Returned**

BadRequest: 400 Name discount_amount not found inside i

**FIX**


**Issue**  
The `order_items` table also does not include a `list_price` column.  
The price reference fields exist in the `products` table instead.

---

### ‚úÖ Prompt 2 ‚Äì Final Fix
**Prompt to Gemini**
 Correct the SQL by referencing the correct price column from the products table.  
 Use p.retail_price instead of list_price to compute the average discount rate as (p.retail_price - i.sale_price)/p.retail_price.  
 Keep CTE structure, joins, and aggregation by category and gender.

**Working SQL Snippet**
```sql
AVG(SAFE_DIVIDE(p.retail_price - i.sale_price, p.retail_price)) AS avg_discount_rate
```
Result
‚úÖ Query executed successfully.
‚úÖ Joined correct tables (order_items, products, users).
‚úÖ Produced valid metrics for total revenue, discount percent, and average order value by gender and category.
‚úÖ Generated interactive Plotly bar chart grouped by gender.

Prompt 3

**Final Prompt Used**  
> Using the public BigQuery dataset `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`, write a SQL query that compares the average order value (AOV) between first-time and repeat customers. Each user‚Äôs first completed order should be labeled as ‚ÄòFirst-time‚Äô and all subsequent orders as ‚ÄòRepeat‚Äô. Use a CTE to calculate per-order revenue by summing `sale_price` from `order_items`, then apply a window function (`ROW_NUMBER`) to tag the orders. Finally, aggregate by customer type to compute order counts and average AOV.  

**AI Output Evaluation & Refinement**  
- Gemini‚Äôs first draft omitted a filter for completed statuses and rounded `AVG()` inside SQL, causing float errors in BigQuery.  
- Fixed by adding `WHERE o.status IN (...)` and moved rounding to Pandas.  
- Final query returned balanced AOVs (‚âà $86) for both groups.

Prompt 4

**Final Prompt Used**  
> Using the public BigQuery dataset `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`, write SQL to test whether larger discounts increase order volume but reduce profit per order. Compute per-order totals by joining `orders` and `order_items` (filter to completed statuses): `revenue = SUM(sale_price)`, `discount_amt = SUM(discount)`, `cost_amt = SUM(cost)`, `profit = revenue ‚àí cost_amt`, and `discount_rate = discount_amt / (revenue + discount_amt)`. Use CTEs and a window function to bucket orders into 5 discount tiers (`NTILE` over `discount_rate`). Finally, aggregate by tier to return order count, average revenue, average profit per order, and average discount_rate in ascending tier order.  

**Fail ‚Üí Fix Example #1**  
- **Fail:** Initial prompt assumed a `discount` column existed in `order_items`, leading to a ‚ÄúField not found‚Äù error and 0 values.  
- **Fix:** Derived discount with `GREATEST(retail_price ‚àí sale_price, 0)` from `products`, joined `products` for `cost` and `retail_price`, and re-computed `discount_rate`.  
- **Result:** Query executed successfully and revealed flat profit across discount tiers (‚âà \$41‚Äì\$48).  

**Additional Refinement**  
- Replaced `NTILE(4)` with `NTILE(5)` for more balanced tiering.  
- Moved aggregation to final CTE to simplify grouping and avoid duplicate rows.

Prompt 5

**Final Prompt Used**  
> Using `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce`, write SQL to identify which product categories are most seasonal. Build monthly revenue by category (`orders` √ó `order_items` √ó `products`; filter completed statuses). Then, with window functions, compute MoM and YoY percent changes per category using `LAG`. Aggregate to a category-level summary returning `avg_abs_mom_change` (average absolute MoM change), `sd_mom_change`, `total_revenue`, and counts of months with MoM/YoY coverage. Order by `avg_abs_mom_change` (descending) and limit to the top 15 categories. Use CTEs throughout.  

**Fail ‚Üí Fix Example #2**  
- **Fail:** Early prompt joined `events` instead of `orders`, causing duplicate category rows and inconsistent month counts.  
- **Fix:** Removed `events` join, retained only `orders` + `order_items` + `products`, and added `WHERE o.status IN (...)` to filter valid sales.  
- **Result:** Clean output (15 categories) with accurate month-over-month volatility; ‚ÄúJumpsuits & Rompers,‚Äù ‚ÄúClothing Sets,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkirts‚Äù showed highest seasonality.  

**Additional Refinement**  
- Added `STDDEV_POP(mom_pct_change)` as `sd_mom_change` for variability metric.  
- Rounded floats to 4 decimals for Looker compatibility.

### üìä Prompt 6 ‚Äì Regional Sales and Profit Insights  
**Visuals Used:** Sales % by Region + Top 10 Regions by Profit  

The regional breakdown of sales and profit reveals both concentration and opportunity within *The Look‚Äôs* current market footprint.  
The **Sales % by Region** and **Top 10 Regions by Profit** visuals show that *China* (34.4%) and *the United States* (22.1%) together generate over **55% of total revenue**, with *China alone contributing 34.4%*.  
Despite this dominance, profitability is strongest in **Asian markets** such as *China* and *South Korea*, where margins are higher relative to costs.  
Western markets deliver strong revenue volume but thinner profit margins, suggesting potential inefficiencies in fulfillment or pricing.  
This regional contrast highlights an opportunity for *The Look* to balance its portfolio‚Äîmaintaining growth in mature regions while expanding profit-focused operations in emerging ones.
