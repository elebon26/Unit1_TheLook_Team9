👋 Hello, and Welcome to Our Analysis on The Look!

To reproduce our individual results, simply replace the following line in the code:

client = bigquery.Client(project="database-project-467")   # 👈 use your Project ID here


with your own GCP project name.
After you do this, the queries integrated in Python should all work as intended.

We also included a report in our team folder illustrating all of our findings.

As an example of our project, we demonstrated how prompt engineering can be used to troubleshoot and refine model responses when facing errors.
The GIF below illustrates this iterative improvement process in action.
